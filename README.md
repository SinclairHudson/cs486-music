## TODO

- [x] split training into 2 sections: 1 with high LR + L2 + frequent codebook restarts and a second with L1 and decaying LR.
2. visualize codebook distributions, upload audio, and latent space information/size to wandb
3. go more resnet-type models, should be easier to train with skip connections
4. Get a test set going...
2. positional encodings so the decoder knows what frequency is what
